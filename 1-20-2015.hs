pointAverage x xTwo = (x + xTwo) / 2 

--The midpoint formula is (x1 + x2) / 2  ,   (y1 + y2)  / 2.   Haskell is not going to print those values out in 
--coordinate notation. There can't be a midpoint function. There can be an average point function, which is exactly what the midpoint formula is,
--except that it applies that average twice. One for the y values, and one for the x values. The two average points are the new x and y coordinates. 

--So what is the midpoint of a line segment/ It is the
